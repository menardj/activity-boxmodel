        <p>This yellow-eyed, black-beaked white bird is easily recognizable. It is 20–28 in long, with a wingspan of 49–59 in. They can weigh anywhere from 3.5 to 6.6 lb. It is one of the largest species of owl and, in North America, is on average the heaviest owl species. The adult male is virtually pure white, but females and young birds have some dark scalloping; the young are heavily barred, and dark spotting may even predominate. Its thick plumage, heavily feathered taloned feet, and colouration make the Snowy Owl well-adapted for life north of the Arctic Circle.</p>

        <p>Small rodents are the most common prey for the Snowy Owl. Some larger prey the owls hunt have been rabbits, raccoons, and prairie dogs among others. Roughly, an owl must capture 7 to 12 mice per day to meet its daily food requirements.</p>
